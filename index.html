    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <div class="box1">
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
            <li> <span class="line-through"> CSS is not necessary </span><span class="bgcolor"> CSS saves a lot of
                    work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
            <li> <span class="italic"> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files </span></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    </p>
    <h2> CSS can be added to HTML document in three ways: </h2>
    <div class="box2">
        <ul type="disc" class="ul">
            <li> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
            <li> Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li> External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file </li>
            <li> The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="letter"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is
            easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to one unique element .ID is
        also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by JavaScript.
        <br><br>

        In CSS ,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on webpage .Once an element has
        been targeted, a style can be applied to the elements. <br><br>
        There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be appliued.
